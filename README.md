# Brain-wide mapping of oligodendrocytes

## Data sharing through neuroglancer
All brains are hosted through AWS S3 and linked to neuroglancer for easy viewing. More brains will be uploaded along with corresponding registered atlases. Current available data can be found at: [https://bossdb.org/project/xu2024](https://bossdb.org/project/xu2024)

- P60 Mobp-EGFP brain
- Cuprizone treated (6 wks) Mobp-EGFP brain
- Cuprizone treated (6wks) + Recovery (3 wks) Mobp-EGFP brain
- P620 Mobp-EGFP brain

## Analysis and model training
Final code and usage wiki for clearing pipeline will be completed at final publication.
